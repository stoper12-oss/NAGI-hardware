## Overview  
NAGI-Hardware defines the first physical computing architecture purpose-built for **Neuro-Adaptive General Intelligence (NAGI)**.  
Unlike traditional von Neumann machines that separate memory and processing, the **NAC (Neuro-Adaptive Computer)** unifies them through dynamically reconfigurable “neural fabrics” — self-optimizing logic planes capable of reassigning physical computation pathways based on cognitive load.

This platform is designed to support **true coevolution** between software cognition and hardware topology.  
Where NAGI-Core provides the four-core cognitive framework (Logic, Empathy, Foresight, Practicality), NAC supplies the physical substrate that grows and rebalances around it.

## Current Status  
The NAC system is **in theoretical and design development**.  
No physical hardware exists yet.  
This repository establishes the conceptual groundwork and early simulation scaffolding for prototype testing and fabrication.

## Technical Vision  

### 1. Architecture Overview  
**Core Philosophy:** Every component — logic cell, memory cell, signal path — participates in feedback with the software layer.  
Hardware and software form a *closed adaptive circuit* capable of evolving structural efficiency through direct experience.

**Key Subsystems (proposed):**
- **Neural Fabric Array (NFA):** A lattice of reconfigurable computation nodes acting as synthetic dendrites. Each node can switch between processing and memory roles dynamically.  
- **Adaptive Bus Matrix (ABM):** A multi-path data fabric enabling hardware-level cognitive routing; pathways are prioritized by context and predicted intent.  
- **Quantum-Class Logic Modulators (QLMs):** Precision logic with analog control regions, bridging digital determinism and analog gradient processing.  
- **Cognitive Energy Distributor (CED):** Power regulation tied to cognitive demand; attention-based power delivery to active clusters.

### 2. Software Integration  
NAC runs the **NAGI-Core Cognitive Framework** natively at the hardware layer.  
Each Core maps to a hardware partition for a **quad-symbiotic architecture**:

| NAGI Core | Hardware Partner | Function |
|-----------|------------------|---------|
| Logic Core | Logic Mesh | Truth validation & reasoning matrix |
| Empathy Core | Emotional Coupler | Moral weighting & adaptive bias tuning |
| Foresight Core | Predictive Fabric | Probabilistic outcome simulation |
| Practicality Core | Sensory Integrator | Contextual grounding & constraint balancing |

A **neuro-synced feedback loop** enables real-time evolution without firmware flashing.

## Future Direction  
- Co-design of adaptive transistor mesh layouts  
- Real-time self-healing power grid testing  
- Memory-in-motion simulation (dynamic memory clustering)  
- FPGA-to-ASIC migration toward a physical prototype
